	            <span class="emphsis_ba">Asbestos</span> is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long, thin fibrous 
	            crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic "fibrils" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. Their colors 
	            are: blue asbestos, brown asbestos and white asbestos.<br /><br />
				Mining for asbestos began more than 4000 years ago, but did not start large-scale until the end of the 19th century when manufacturers and builders 
				used asbestos because of its desirable physical properties: sound absorption, tensile strength, resistance to fire, heat, electrical and chemical 
				damage, and affordability. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos 
				is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. Asbestos was a very widely used 
				material, it continued to grow throughout most of the 20th century until the carcinogenic effects of asbestos dust caused its effective demise 
				as a mainstream construction and fireproofing material in most countries. It is now known that prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers can 
				cause serious and fatal illnesses including malignant lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis). Health issues 
				related to asbestos exposure can be found in records dating back to Roman times. By the beginning of the 20th Century, concerns were 
				beginning to be raised, which escalated in severity during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1980s and 1990s asbestos trade and use started 
				to become banned outright.

	            <h4 class="header-3">Types of Asbestos</h4>
		            <h5>
			            Asbestos was once mined in many places throughout the world; however, now it can be found predominately in Canada, 
			            Russia, Africa, and China. Asbestos is a naturally-occurring mineral that was used for decades as an insulator for a 
			            host of products, many of which have been used in homes throughout the world.
			        	<br /><br />
			        	Six different types of asbestos have been identified. These types are divided into two groups:
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Serpentine</span> – This variety of asbestos has a layered structure and curly fibers. 
								Chrysotile asbestos is the only type in this category and was the kind of asbestos most often used in buildings 
								in the United States.</li>
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Amphibole</span> – This kind of asbestos is characterized by a long chain-like structure 
								of fibers that are sharp and straight and easy to inhale. This category is comprised of the remaining five types of 
								asbestos: amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite. Amosite and crocidolite were widely used in 
								products until the 1980s and amosite is recognized as the second most likely type to be found in buildings.</li>
						</ul>
						
			            These types of asbestos are often categorized by their color, although tremolite, anthophyllite, and actinolite remain unclassified.
			        	<br /><br />
			        	Six different types of asbestos have been identified. These types are divided into two groups:
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>White – chrysotile</li>
							<li>Brown – amosite</li>
							<li>Blue – crocidolite</li>
						</ul>
					</h5>
          			
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Amosite Asbestos</h4>
		           <h5>
			            The commercial production of amosite, or “brown” asbestos, ended within the last decade and this type of asbestos is no longer mined. 
			            It was at one time, however, the second-most commonly used form of asbestos and, as a result, many individuals were exposed to it during 
			            its peak use. Amosite was employed as insulation in factories and buildings, as well as both an acoustical and anti-condensation material. 
			            Its use has been banned in most countries for approximately the last 30 years.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Crocidolite Asbestos</h4>
		           <h5>
			            Crocidolite asbestos accounted for about four percent of all asbestos once used in North America. This “blue” asbestos is harder and more 
			            brittle than other types of the mineral and can break easily, releasing dangerous needle-like fibers that are easily inhaled. Crocidolite, 
			            without a doubt, is the most lethal form of asbestos. It was often used in making yarns and rope lagging, and as a reinforcement material 
			            for plastics.<br /><br />
						Crocidolite was generally mined in Western Australia, Bolivia, and South Africa. The percentage of miners who developed asbestos cancer 
						due to crocidolite exposure stands at a staggering 18 percent. The town of Wittenoom, Australia (population 20,000), where blue asbestos 
						was mined for many years, had more than 1,000 people die of mesothelioma with officials estimating that another 1,000 will eventually perish 
						from asbestos-related diseases. The town is now a ghost town, with only eight residents remaining, and has literally been erased from the map.

					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Chrysotile Asbestos</h4>
		           <h5>
			            The most common type of asbestos and the only kind that is still mined, chrysotile was the most widely used in the world’s developed countries. 
			            Estimates show that about 90-95 percent of all asbestos that remains in buildings in the U.S. and Canada is of this variety. Obviously, because 
			            it was the most widely used, it accounts for the most health problems, though the companies that mine it continue to attest to its safety. 
			            <br /><br />
						Chrysotile is most often used in fireproofing and in insulation products and was widely used aboard U.S. Navy ships during World War II and 
						the Korean War. It can also be woven into cloth and was once used in theater curtains and – ironically – to make protective clothing for those 
						who worked with high temperature equipment or liquids. It was also an ingredient in cement and was helpful in the manufacture of friction 
						products because of its heat-resistant properties. These included brake shoes, clutches, and disk pads. Its most recent uses were in the 
						nuclear energy industry.
			            <br /><br />
						Most experts maintain that ALL asbestos can cause cancer, even chrysotile, and even when exposure is minimal. This has been demonstrated 
						by the fact that those who live near chrysotile mines have a much higher incidence of mesothelioma than the general public.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Anthophyllite Asbestos</h4>
		           <h5>
			           Anthophyllite asbestos, also known as “brown” asbestos is composed predominantly of iron and magnesium. The fibers are known to be long 
			           and flexible. Of the amphibole asbestos sub-classification, brown asbestos can be found in many talc mines and has been associated different 
			           respiratory disorders, though is not conclusively associated with mesothelioma as other varieties of asbestos are.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Tremolite Asbestos</h4>
		           <h5>
			           As an amphibole variety of asbestos fiber, tremolite asbestos is indeed associated with the development of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related 
			           cancer. Like other varieties of asbestos, tremolite asbestos is composed predominantly of magnesium and can range from off-white 
			           to a dark green in color. Tremolite asbestos is particularly common in vermiculite and vermiculite deposits.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Actinolite Asbestos</h4>
		           <h5>
			           Actinolite asbestos is a variety of the sub-classification of amphibole asbestos and, as such, its makeup and consistency is similar to 
			           other forms of this subset. Made predominantly of magnesium, actinolite asbestos is extremely rare and ranges in color from white to 
			           dark brown. Actinolite was not known to be used in asbestos products because of its rarity, but is known to be found in metamorphic rock.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
	            <h4 class="header-3">Health Impact</h4>
		           <h5>
			           All types of asbestos fibers are known to cause serious health hazards in humans. Amosite and crocidolite are considered the most hazardous 
			           asbestos fiber types, however chrysotile asbestos has also produced tumors in animals and is a recognized cause of asbestosis and malignant 
			           mesothelioma in humans.
			           <br /><br />
					   Exposure to asbestos in the form of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is friable, or 
					   materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk.
					   <br /><br />
					   According to the National Cancer Institute, "A history of asbestos exposure at work is reported in about 70 percent to 80 percent of all 
					   cases. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos”.
					   <br /><br />
					   Smoking has a supra-additive effect in increasing the risk of lung cancer in those exposed to asbestos. Studies have shown an increased 
					   risk of lung cancer among smokers who are exposed to asbestos compared to non-smokers.

				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Types of Asbestos</h4>
		            <h5>
			            Diseases commonly associated with asbestos:
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Asbestosis</span>: Progressive fibrosis of the lungs of varying severity, progressing to bilateral 
								fibrosis, honeycombing of the lungs on radiological view with symptoms including rales and wheezing. Individuals who have 
								been exposed to asbestos via home, environment, work should notify their doctors about exposure history.</li>
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Asbestos warts</span>: caused when the sharp fibers lodge in the skin and are overgrown causing 
								benign callus-like growths.</li>
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Pleural plaques</span>: discrete fibrous or partially calcified thickened area which can be seen 
								on X-rays of individuals exposed to asbestos. Although pleural plaques are themselves asymptomatic, in some patients this 
								develops into pleural thickening.</li>
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Diffuse pleural thickening</span>: similar to above and can sometimes be associated with asbestosis. 
								Usually no symptoms shown but if exposure is extensive, it can cause lung impairment.</li>
							<li><span class="emphsis_ba">Pneumothorax</span>: Some reports have also linked the condition of pneumothorax to asbestos related diseases</li>
						</ul>
						
						It is important to consult a doctor, particularly if the following symptoms develop: shortness of breath, wheezing or hoarseness, 
						persistent cough that worsens over time, blood in fluid coughed up, pain or tightening in chest, difficulty swallowing, swelling 
						of neck or face, decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue or anemia.

						<br /><br />
						<span class="emphsis_ba">Vermiculite</span> contaminated with asbestos from the Libby mine was used as insulation in residential 
						and commercial buildings through Canada and the United States. W. R. Grace and Company's loose-fill vermiculite was marketed as 
						Zonolite but was also used in sprayed-on products such as Monokote.

				<h4 class="header-3">Safety and Exposure Prevention</h4>
		            <h5>
			            Asbestos exposure becomes an issue if asbestos containing materials become airborne, such as due to deterioration or damage. 
			            Building occupants may be exposed to asbestos, but those most at risk are persons who purposely disturb materials, such as 
			            maintenance or construction workers. Housekeeping or custodial employees may be at an increased risk as they may potentially 
			            clean up damaged or deteriorated asbestos containing materials without knowing that the material contains asbestos. Asbestos 
			            abatement or remediation workers and emergency personnel such as firefighters may also become exposed. 
					</h5>
          			
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Common Building Materials Containing Asbestos</h4>
		            <h5>
			            Residential building materials containing asbestos include a variety of products, such as: stipple used in textured walls and 
			            ceilings; drywall joint filler compound; asbestos contaminated vermiculite, vinyl floor tile; vinyl sheet flooring; window 
			            putty; mastic; cement board; asbestos cement pipes and flues; furnace tape; and stucco. Asbestos is widely used in roofing 
			            materials, mainly corrugated asbestos cement roof sheets and asbestos shingles sometimes called transite. Other sources of 
			            asbestos-containing materials include fireproofing and acoustic materials.
						<br /><br />
						A fiber cannot be identified or ruled out as asbestos, either using the naked eye or by simply looking at a fiber under a 
						regular microscope. The most common methods of identifying asbestos fibers are by using polarized light microscopy or transmission 
						electron microscopy.   If asbestos abatement is performed, completion of the abatement is verified using visual confirmation and 
						may also involve air sampling. Air samples are typically analyzed using phase contrast microscopy (PCM). PCM involves counting 
						fibers on a filter using a microscope. Airborne occupational exposure limits for asbestos are based on using the PCM method.
						<br /><br />
						Friability of a product containing asbestos means that it is so soft and weak in structure that it can be broken with simple finger 
						crushing pressure. Friable materials are of the most initial concern because of their ease of damage.
					</h5>
          			
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">History</h4>
		            <h5>
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>Industrial scale mining began in the Thetford hills, Quebec from the 1870s. Sir William Edmond Logan was the first to notice 
								the large deposits of chrysotile in the hills in his capacity as head of Geological Survey of Canada. </li>
							<li>In 1876, in Quebec Central Railway, mining entrepreneurs, established the asbestos industry in the province. The 50 ton output 
								of the mines in 1878 rose to over 10,000 tons in the 1890s with the adoption of machine technologies and expanded production. 
								For a long time, the world's largest asbestos mine was the Jeffrey mine in the town of Asbestos, Quebec.</li>
							<li>Amphiboles including amosite (brown asbestos) and crocidolite (blue asbestos) were formerly used in many products until the 
								early 1980s. Tremolite asbestos constituted a contaminant of many if not all naturally occurring chrysotile deposits. The use 
								of all types of asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in much of the Western world by the mid-1980s, and in Japan by 1995.</li>
							<li>The United States government and asbestos industry have been criticized for not acting quickly enough to inform the public of 
								dangers, and to reduce public exposure. In the late 1970s court documents proved that asbestos industry officials knew of 
								asbestos dangers since the 1930s and had concealed them from the public.</li>

			<h1>MOLD</h1>
            
            <h5>
	            Mold spores are a common component of household and workplace dust.  When spores are present in large quantities, they are a health hazard to 
	            humans, potentially causing allergic reactions and respiratory problems.
				<br /><br />
				Some molds produce mycotoxins that can pose serious health risks to humans and animals. The term "toxic mold" refers to molds that produce 
				mycotoxins, such as Stachybotrys chartarum, not to all molds. Exposure to high levels of mycotoxins can lead to neurological problems and 
				in some cases death. Prolonged exposure can be particularly harmful.

		            <h5>
			            Infants may develop respiratory symptoms as a result of exposure to a specific type of fungal mold, called Penicillium. 
			            Signs that an infant may have mold-related respiratory problems include (but are not limited to) a persistent cough and/or wheeze. 
			            Increased exposure increases the probability of developing respiratory symptoms during their first year of life. Studies have shown

				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Causes & Growing Conditions</h4>
		            <h5>
	          			Molds are found everywhere inside and outside, and can grow on almost any substance when moisture is present. Molds reproduce by spores, 
	          			which can be carried by air currents. When these spores land on a moist surface that is suitable for life, they begin to grow.
						<br /><br />
						Common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth. Flooding, leaky roofs, building maintenance problems, or indoor plumbing 
						problems can lead to mold growth inside. Moisture, vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture containing air which 
						enables mold to flourish. 
						<br /><br />
						Common building materials, such as plywood, drywall, furring strips, carpets, and carpet padding are food for molds. In carpet, invisible 
						dust and cellulose are the food sources (see also dust mites). After a single incident of water damage occurs in a building, molds grow 
						inside walls and then become dormant until a subsequent incident of high humidity; this illustrates how mold can appear to be a sudden 
						problem, after a previous flood or water incident that did not produce such a problem. The right conditions reactivate mold.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Spores need three things to grow into mold: </h4>
		            <h5>
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>Nutrients: Cellulose is a common food for spores in an indoor environment. It is the part of the cell wall of green plants.</li>
							<li>Moisture: Moisture is required to begin the decaying process caused by the mold.</li>
							<li>Time: Mold growth begins between 24 hours and 10 days from the provision of the growing conditions. There is no known way to date mold.</li>
						</ul>
						The main problem with the presence of mold in buildings is the inhalation of mycotoxins. Molds may produce an identifiable smell.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Removing one of the three requirements for mold reduces or eliminates the new growth of mold. These three requirements are: </h4>
		            <h5>
		            	1.	Moisture<br />
						2.	Food source for the mold spores (dust, dander, etc.)<br />
						3.	Warmth (mold generally does not grow in cold environments).
						<br /><br />
						HVAC systems can create all three requirements for significant mold growth. The A/C system creates a difference in temperature that 
						allows/causes condensation to occur. The high rate of dusty air movement through an HVAC system may create ample sources of food for the mold.
						<br /><br />
						Because the HVAC system circulates air contaminated with mold spores and sometimes toxins, it is vital to prevent any three of 
						the environments required for mold growth. However, thorough cleaning of the HVAC system is required before usage of high efficiency 
						filtration systems will help.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Assessment</h4>
		            <h5>
		            	The first step in an assessment is to determine if mold is present. This is done by visually examining the premises. Sometimes 
		            	intrusive methods are needed to assess the level of mold contamination. This would include moving furniture, lifting and/or removing 
		            	carpets, checking behind wallpaper or paneling, checking in ventilation duct work, opening and exposing wall cavities, etc.
						<br /><br />
						Careful detailed visual inspection and recognition of moldy odors should be used to find problems needing correction. Efforts should 
						focus on areas where there are signs of liquid moisture or water vapor (humidity) or where moisture problems are suspected. The 
						investigation goals should be to locate indoor mold growth to determine how to correct the moisture problem and remove contamination 
						safely and effectively.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Sampling</h4>
		            <h5>
		            	Three types of sampling include but are not limited to:
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>Air sampling</li>
							<li>Surface samples</li>
							<li>Bulk samples</li>
						</ul>
						Though it may not be recommended, air sampling following mold remediation is usually the best way to ascertain efficacy of remediation.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Remediation</h4>
		            <h5>
		            	The first step in solving an indoor mold problem is stopping the source of moisture. Next is to remove the mold growth. Common remedies for 
		            	small occurrences of mold include:
		            	
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>Sunlight</li>
							<li>Ventilation</li>
							<li>Wall insulation/Dry Wall</li>
							<li>Non-porous building materials</li>
							<li>Household cleansers</li>
							<li>Dehumidifiers</li>
						</ul>
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Cleanup and removal methods</h4>
		            <h5>
		            	The purpose of the clean-up process is to eliminate the mold and fungal growth and to remove contaminated materials. As a general rule, 
		            	simply killing the mold with a biocide is not enough. The mold must be removed since the chemicals and proteins, which cause a reaction 
		            	in humans, are still present even in dead mold.
					</h5>
				<div class="h_30"></div>
				<h4 class="header-3">Evaluating mold exposures</h4>
		            <h5>
		            	Before we begin your home mold remediation, it is best to have an expert come into the place of business. We will make sure to assess 
		            	the area infected with mold to ensure safety, then cleanup the entire moldy area, and properly approach the mold.
		            	
	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>Assess the area infected with mold, checking for any hidden mold</li>

	          			<ul class="list_circle"> 
							<li>First, make sure to remove any object near the insulation system that may have been contaminated from floodwater. Properly 
								dispose of the contaminated materials according to your local, state, and Federal regulations. (The insulation you might remove 
								may be contaminated with asbestos. Always make sure to call a trained professional to avoid serious injury or death)</li>
							<li>Make sure to remove the contaminated HVAC filter media to ensure your HVAC system is not bringing in contaminated air. Make 
								sure to dispose of it reading the same regulations listed above.</li>
							<li>Remove any debris and insulation; clean all components of the HVAC system to ensure nothing becomes contaminated and/or more 
								contaminated from floodwater. Use a HEPA-filtered vacuum, cleaner to make sure you get rid of all the debris, dirt, and 
								microorganisms. Pay special attention to the drain pans, filter areas, curves, and air ducts since debris often collects 
								in these places.</li>
							<li>Disinfect all components of the HVAC system after turning off the HVAC system. To clean use 1 cup of normal household 
								chlorine bleach mixed with a gallon of water, do not mix this with cleaning products containing ammonia.</li>
							<li>Be sure to use fans to create filtration by blowing the contaminated air outdoors, to protect the health of the workers.</li>
							<li>After cleaning all components with bleach rinse with clean water to eliminate the potent bleach smells.
								
	          					<ul class="list_circle"> 
	          						<li>Important: You must remove and properly discard the HVAC components that are contaminated with floodwater to prevent 
	          							the growth of mold if it cannot be cleaned, and replace them with new components.</li>
	          					</ul>
								</li>
							<li>After the HVAC has been properly cleaned and disinfected, replace the insulation in the HVAC system with an external, 
								smooth-surfaced insulation to prevent future floodwater contamination.</li>
							<li>To ensure safety have your HVAC system tested by a qualified professional before you begin using your HVAC system again.</li>
