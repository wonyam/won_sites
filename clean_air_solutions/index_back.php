            	Whether you are maintaining a residential or commercial property, it is recommended you have your furnace 
            	and ducts cleaned every 2-3 years. That’s because the build up of dust you see around you is also happening 
            	in places you don’t see – such as your furnace and ducts. Cleaning and servicing once every 2-3 years makes 
            	sure your air is clean, and your furnace is running at maximum efficiency.

				            	If your house or commercial building was built before 1990, chances are it may contain asbestos. For nearly 
				            	100 years, it was one of the most commonly used materials in construction, shipbuilding and manufacturing. 
				            	It was used extensively because it is such a good insulator, has good fire protection properties, has tensile 
				            	strength, and is resistant to chemical erosion. <br /> <br />
											We now know that asbestos causes serious health issues. Daily exposure to asbestos can increase one’s risk 
											of lung disease dramatically. If products containing asbestos are disturbed, tiny asbestos fibres are 
											released into the air. When asbestos fibres are inhaled, they may get trapped in the lungs and remain there 
											for life. Over time, fibres can accumulate and cause scarring and inflammation, which can affect breathing 
											and lead to serious health problems such as lung cancer. <br /><br />
											Our asbestos abatement team has comprehensive knowledge of the latest regulations from all government levels, 
											ensuring we get the job done right the first time. Kapstone offers asbestos testing and removal services that 
											adhere to the guidelines of Occupational Health & Safety, WCB, Alberta Health Services and the BC Work Safe 
											Asbestos Removal Guide.<br /><br />
											Asbestos abatement projects are planned with each client and their staff to accommodate the requirements of 
											the project with the availability of the facility. We have experience with a wide range of buildings 
											throughout the Calgary region, Alberta and BC. All asbestos abatement jobs are completed quickly, 
											efficiently and safely.
