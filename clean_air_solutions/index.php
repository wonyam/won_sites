				            	Ventilation systems are often the biggest culprit in poor indoor air quality. Make it a priority to inspect the ductwork of 
				            	your home or business.
											<br />
											If your HVAC has been operating for some time without attention, it could be circulating odors, dust and other contaminates.
											<br />
											Duct cleaning is not always necessary. Kapstone will make recommendations about the best way to address any indoor air quality concerns. 
											This can save you money and provide peace of mind on the health of your system.
											<br />
											The benefits of servicing your HVAC unit include:
											<ul class="list_circle"> 
												<li>Helps to restore peak energy efficiency.</li>
												<li>May help to eliminate offensive odors.</li>
												<li>Helps reduce the potential for mold growth.</li>

				            <h5>
				            	Your furnace and ductwork should be cleaned and maintained every 2-3 years to keep them functioning at peak efficiency, save you money on your energy bills, and sustain your home's air quality.
											<br /><br />
											Here is a list that will be performing in your home when we clean your furnace and ducts:
											<ul class="list_circle"> 
												<li>Perform a Multi-Point System Check™ </li>
												<li>Remove and clean the furnace blower</li>
												<li>Create sealed access panels</li>
												<li>Commercial Brush & Air Whip™ the ducts, zone by zone</li>
												<li>Test the ignition and fan operation.</li>
												<li>Disinfect your furnace and ducts with an environmentally safe cleaner</li>
												<li>Replace your common furnace filter</li>
											</ul>
											
											We use a high quality portable HEPA-3 stage filter system for your home just as we do when cleaning the ventilation system in hospitals and schools, this allows the dust from outside staying outside by closing the front door while we clean your furnace and ducts.

				            	If your house or commercial building was built before 1990, chances are it may contain asbestos. For nearly 
				            	100 years, it was one of the most commonly used materials in construction, shipbuilding and manufacturing. 
				            	It was used extensively because it is such a good insulator, has good fire protection properties, has tensile 
				            	strength, and is resistant to chemical erosion. <br /> <br />
											We now know that asbestos causes serious health issues. Daily exposure to asbestos can increase one’s risk 
											of lung disease dramatically. If products containing asbestos are disturbed, tiny asbestos fibres are 
											released into the air. When asbestos fibres are inhaled, they may get trapped in the lungs and remain there 
											for life. Over time, fibres can accumulate and cause scarring and inflammation, which can affect breathing 
											and lead to serious health problems such as lung cancer. <br /><br />
											Our asbestos abatement team has comprehensive knowledge of the latest regulations from all government levels, 
											ensuring we get the job done right the first time. Kapstone offers asbestos testing and removal services that 
											adhere to the guidelines of Occupational Health & Safety, WCB, Alberta Health Services and the BC Work Safe 
											Asbestos Removal Guide.<br /><br />
											Asbestos abatement projects are planned with each client and their staff to accommodate the requirements of 
											the project with the availability of the facility. We have experience with a wide range of buildings 
											throughout the Calgary region, Alberta and BC. All asbestos abatement jobs are completed quickly, 
											efficiently and safely.

							<h5>
								Our certified and experienced companies understand that the last thing you need when you have fire damage to your home is more stress 
								than you already have. You need a company that can handle your emergency fire damage clean up and repairs promptly and professionally - 
								to your satisfaction and peace of mind. The company should successfully: estimate the extent of your fire damage; take care of content 
								restoration and storage; as well as complete all necessary fire damage reconstruction of your property or business. You need to be able 
								to have your life get back to normal and as soon as possible, as though your fire damage emergency never happened.<br />
								There is always residual damage in fires, such as smoke damage, fire odor, soot damage, or ash. While extinguishing house fires, there 
								is usually quite a bit of water damage. Your chosen company should be able to restore and rebuild the fire damaged property. The process 
								can include: taking care of fire, smoke, and water damage.
