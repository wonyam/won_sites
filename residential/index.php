            	Creating a custom home to your unique requirements, specific to your dreams and needs, means delivering our service on time 
            	and on budget. It means offering you a combination of creativity and teamwork, big picture thinking and attention to detail, 
            	At Kapstone, our goal is to meet your expectations fairly every step along the way.
							<br /><br />
							Kapstone understands that when you’re working with us to build something as significant as a custom home, there is another 
							intangible at work – your need for hands-on customer service. That’s why we work with you collaboratively throughout the 
							homebuilding process, from finding the perfect property through to designing, planning, construction, finishing and beyond. 
							You’re not just getting a custom home, you’re getting a customized customer experience throughout your homebuilding journey.

            <h4>Interior and Exterior Design</h4>
            <h5>
            	Kapstone works alongside each customer to ensure you are getting the house of your dreams. Once you approve the plans, 
            	we move into the Design Development phase of your interior design project. This is where we love to explore personalized 
            	interior design options in much greater detail so you can begin to “see” what the end result will look like. Not only do 
            	we discuss the different materials that can be used for the floors, walls, doors and railings, we also take look at selections 
            	for lighting, ceiling design and fixtures. While discussing all these possibilities adds to the excitement of the project, the 
            	Design Development also serves a very important purpose. <br/>
							It’s during this process we develop an understanding of where the project stands in relation to the budget.
							Kapstone will put together preliminary pricing for the construction so we can determine the scope of work.
							Using this approach allows us some flexibility to make changes that could be much more complicated or time consuming if we attempted 
							to make them later on.
